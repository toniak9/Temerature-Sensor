This app converts temperature from Celcius to Fahrenhiet and vice-versa. 
This app is designed to display the temperatures of 5 days in a week; Monday to Friday. Initially, when the activity starts, a random temperature is assigned to each of these days in Celcius. 
A button is associated with each of these days to change the temeperatire from Fahrenhiet to Celcius and vice versa.

The app also displays the ambiet temperature using sensors on top of the activity. This is done through the SensorManager. This freature is supported only from SDK version 19
